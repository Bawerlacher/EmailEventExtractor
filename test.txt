The William Lowell Putnam Competition (http://math.scu.edu/putnam/index.html) is a college level mathematics competition that will take place over the course of two three-hour segments on Saturday December 1st. The questions are proof based and generally fairly difficult. While finding solutions often requires ingenuity and critical thinking, they rarely require knowledge of mathematics beyond calculus or perhaps differential equations (though knowing more advanced topics can be useful at times).
